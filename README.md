Overview
This project involves training a model using the Hugging Face Transformers library. The notebook finetune.ipynb details the process of training and validating a model, likely for a classification task, as suggested by the accuracy and F1 score metrics.

Key Components
Dataset Tokenization: The dataset is tokenized using a tokenizer from the Hugging Face Transformers library.

Model Training: The model is trained using the Trainer class from the Hugging Face Transformers library.

Metrics: During training, the following metrics are tracked:

Training Loss

Validation Loss

Accuracy

F1 Score

Validation: The trained model is evaluated on a validation dataset, and predictions are generated.

Usage


Notebook Execution: Run the finetune.ipynb notebook to train and evaluate the model. The notebook contains the code for data loading, preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.

Prediction: The trainer.predict method is used to generate predictions on the validation dataset. The np.argmax function is used to convert the predicted probabilities into class labels.
